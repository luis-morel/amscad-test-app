        <p className="missionStatement">Gripe is an application that works under
        the principle that mutual dislikes bring people closer than shared interests. Almost
        every dating app collects information regarding people's passions and hobbies. However,
        even if you and a 'match' love many of the same things, if you disagree on one thing
        you hate, your match would be ruined. So instead, why not discuss what you hate? This
        application allows people to share stories in ten different categories about why they
        hate or what they hate about each category —including anything from Donald Trump to
        Traffic on a Monday Morning — using a blog forum. Gripe is a new and refreshing way
        to find a real match. Gripe is making online dating more approachable by replacing
        cumbersome surveys and bios with a fun, alternative way to express your personality.
